        <h1 class="page-header">Setup</h1>
        <p>
        Players split up into two teams of similar size and skill. You
        need at least four players (two teams of two) for a standard
        game.
        <p>
        Each team chooses one player to be their spymaster. Both
        spymasters sit on the same side of the table. The other players
        sit across from their spymasters. They are field operatives.
        <p>
        The grid shows 25 codenames in a 5-by-5 grid. Each codenames has a
        secret identity that the spymasters know. The spymasters can view
        the identities on a separate device by entering the same board ID
        in the input box, selecting 'Change' and then 'Hide/Show'. Don't
        let the field operatives see it.
        <p>
        Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must guess (blue
        agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess
        (red agents). Gray squares are innocent bystanders, and the
        orange square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all!

        <h1 class="page-header">Game Overview</h1>
        <p>
        Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates
        know the agents only by their codenames.
        <p>
        Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to
        multiple words on the grid. The field operatives try to guess which
        words their spymaster meant. When a field operative selects a word,
        it reveals its secret identity. If it is one of their team's agents,
        the operatives may keep guessing. Otherwise, it is the other team's
        turn. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.

        <h1 class="page-header">Game Play</h1>
        <p>
        Teams take turns, starting with the red team.

        <h2>Giving a Clue</h2>
        <p>
        If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue
        that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When
        you think you have a good clue, you say it. You also say one number,
        which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your
        clue.
        <p>
        Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on
        trees, so you say tree: 2.
        <p>
        You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (cashew: 1) but it's
        fun to try for two or more. Getting four words with one clue is a big
        accomplishment.

        <h3>One Word</h3>
        <p>
        Your clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra
        hints. For example, don't say, "This may be a bit of a stretchâ€¦" You
        are playing Codenames. It's always a bit of a stretch.
        <p>
        Your clue cannot be any of the codenames unselected on the grid. On
        later turns, some codenames will be selected, so a clue that is not
        legal now might be legal later.

        <h2>Making Cotact</h2>
        <p>
        When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to
        figure out what it means. They can debate it amongst themselves, but
        the spymaster must keep a straight face. The operatives indicate their
        official guess when one of them selects one of the codenames on the
        grid.

        <ul>
            <li>
                If the field operative selects a word belonging to his or her
                team, the team may guess another word.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the field operative selects an innocent bystander or a word
                belonging to the other team, they end their turn. If the word
                belongs to the other team, it helps them win.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the field operative selects the assassin, the game ends and
                the team that selected the assassin loses!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Number of Guesses</h3>
        <p>
        The field operatives must always make at least one guess. Any wrong
        guess ends the turn immediately, but if the field operatives guess a
        word of their team's color, they can keep guessing.
        <p>
        You can stop guessing at any time, but usually you want to guess as
        many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even want to
        guess one more:
        <p>
        Example: Red Team's first clue was tree: 2. The red operative wanted
        to guess ORANGE and NUT. She guessed ORANGE first. That was an
        innocent bystander, so she did not get a chance to guess NUT.
        <p>
        Blue Team took a turn and correctly guessed two words. Now it is Red
        Team's turn again.
        <p>
        The red spymaster says river: 3. The red operative is pretty sure the
        AMAZON is a river, so she selects that word. The word is red, so she
        gets to go again. A river has a BED, so she selects that codename.
        It's also red, so she can go again.
        <p>
        She's not sure of the third river word. She picks NUT. This has
        nothing to do with river. She is guessing a word from the previous
        clue.
        <p>
        NUT is a red word. The operative has made 3 correct guesses for the
        clue river: 3. She is allowed one final guess. She can try to find the
        third river word, or she can try to find the other tree word. Or she
        can stop at three and let Blue Team have a turn.
        <p>
        You are allowed only one extra guess. In the example above, the red
        operative would be allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said the
        number 3. When the field operatives say they are done guessing (or
        when they guess wrong) it is the other team's turn.

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <p>
        Spymasters take turns giving clues. Each turn covers up at least one
        word, which makes guessing progressively easier.

        <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
        <p>
        The game ends when one team has all their words covered. That team
        wins.
        <p>
        It is possible to win on the other team's turn if they guess your last
        word.
        <p>
        The game can end early if a field operative makes contact with the
        assassin. That operative's team loses.

        <h3>Setup for the Next Game</h3>
        <p>
        Do other players want a chance to be spymasters? Setup for the second
        game is easy. Refresh the page or choose a new board ID to get a fresh
        board, and you're ready to go!
